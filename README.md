# Infer# GitHub Action

**Infer#** is an interprocedural and scalable static code analyzer for C#. Via the capabilities of Facebook's [Infer](https://fbinfer.com/), this tool detects race condition, null pointer dereferences and resource leaks. Its source code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/infersharp).

![Sample Report](https://github.com/microsoft/infersharpaction/blob/main/assets/samplereport.png)

## Usage
```yml
- name: Run Infer#      
  uses: microsoft/infersharpaction@v1.2
  id: runinfersharp
  with:
    binary-path: '<path to the binary directory containing .dlls and .pdbs>'

- name: Infer# analysis results
  run: echo "${{ steps.runinfersharp.outputs.results }}" >> report.txt

- name: Upload Infer# report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: report
    path: report.txt
```

### Parameters
#### `binary-path`
**Required** Path to the binary directory containing .dlls **and** .pdbs.

## Limitations
- GitHub does not currently support Linux containers hosted on Windows; your CI pipeline must run on Linux. If it doesn't, you may still apply the analyzer by creating a dependent workflow which transports the binaries to a Linux host on which to run the analysis.

- If the project is too large, the analysis may time out.

- The analyzer may report warnings outside of your own code. This is because it runs on all input .pdbs, including those belonging to third-party library references. To prevent this, isolate the desired binaries in the input `binary-path` directory.

## Troubleshooting
- Please see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/infersharp/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for troubleshooting tips.
